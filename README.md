# replicating-simple-blackbox-attack
This repository replicates the code and results of the paper ["Simple Black-box Adversarial Attacks"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.07121.pdf). The original code can be found [here](https://github.com/cg563/simple-blackbox-attack).

The idea is to not to blindly copy the official code of the authors, but to implement it independently.
